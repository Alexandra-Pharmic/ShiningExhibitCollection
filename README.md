Notes:
* I dropped the "block is retained" part of the blue Sakuya exhibit because I felt that it was too good.
* The white Sakuya exhibit also makes Knives do more damage. This serves to keep the exhibit from being a strictly worse version of the white Reimu one. 
* Improved Mixture doesn't upgrade Potions added directly to the hand by Radioactive Elements. This is probably an acceptable edge case though.
