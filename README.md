* I dropped the "block is retained" part of the blue Sakuya exhibit because I felt that it was in an awkward spot - too good in many fights, but useless for many boss battles.
* The white Sakuya exhibit also makes Knives do more damage. This serves to keep the exhibit from being a strictly worse version of the white Reimu one. 
* Improved Mixture doesn't upgrade Potions added directly to the hand by Radioactive Elements. This is probably an acceptable edge case though. 
* The Marisa exhibits can only be obtained if you have the matching Marisa exhibit of the *same* color. TODO: Also allow it if you have the "wrong" Marisa exhibit, but access to the "correct" color through other means.
* TODO: Find out why Knife Tsukumogami's description shows up as "<Error>".
* Balance changes: The ones that make tokens cheaper could be limited to once per turn if they're too good as-is.
