This is a collection of Shining Exhibits designed to synergize with character mechanics, and only show up if you have an Exhibit belonging to the character in question.

Inspired by this: https://discord.com/channels/1040229874176098344/1041404940431

## General notes:

* Some of these might be reworked into starter exhibit upgrades to make them a bit rarer and weaker.
* I might tweak these to still work if you chose to swap your starter Exhibit because this mod currently makes boss swapping worse. 

## Notes for each Exhibit:

### Youkai Hunting Needles

* The effect might be reworked. It's fine, but a little bland.

### Last Resort Talisman

* If this is too OP as-is, I can try changing it to once per turn.

### Overclocked Circuitry

* Can only be obtained if you specifically have the red Marisa exhibit. The black one doesn't help Burst much.
* Might be tweaked to also appear if you have the black Marisa exhibit and at least 2 red pips in your base mana.
* It provides mana instead of changing how much mana Burst itself provides. This probably doesn't matter other than looking a bit weird.

### Improved Mixture

* Can only be obtained if you specifically have the black Marisa exhibit. The red one doesn't help Unstable Potions much.
* Might be tweaked to also appear if you have the red Marisa exhibit and at least 2 black pips in your base mana.
* It doesn't upgrade Potions added directly to the hand by Radioactive Elements. This is probably an acceptable edge case though. I don't know if Faithful Meditation does either.

### Knife Tsukogami
* I added damage to the knives because this would otherwise be strictly worse than Last Resort Talisman.
* I didn't go with Xeno's "knives always deal damage as though they were played" alternative because I felt that it might be too good, and that it would be interesting to occasionally encourage players to play the knives.
* TODO: Find out why Knife Tsukumogami's description shows up as "Error".

### Gear of Time
* The original suggestion was "after your first turn, take another turn and retain your block". I thought that sounded too OP and went with Xeno's suggestion of instead adding mana whenever an extra turn starts.
* I originally considered some restrictions on it because many of Sakuya's extra turn cards have a double white pip or a double blue pip in their cost, but figured that it would be fine because every character has an extra turn card in their pool.
* I might tweak the effect because for non-Sakuya extra turns, the effect amounts to cancelling out the Time Limit mechanic.


### Sharpened Icicle
* TODO: Find out why this doesn't apply Cold.


### Three Fairies' Flag
* TODO: Implement this properly.
