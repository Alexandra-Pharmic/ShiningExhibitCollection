This is a collection of Shining Exhibits designed to synergize with character mechanics, and only show up if you have an Exhibit belonging to the character in question.

Inspired by this: https://discord.com/channels/1040229874176098344/1041404940431

## General notes:

* Some of these might be reworked into starter exhibit upgrades to make them a bit rarer and weaker.
* I might tweak these to still work if you chose to swap your starter Exhibit because this mod currently makes boss swapping worse. 
* All of these need illustrations.

## Notes for each Exhibit:

### Youkai Hunting Needles
Effect: Start each combat with 3 Firepower if it's an elite or boss fight, and with firepower equal to the number of enemies otherwise.

* The effect might be reworked. It's fine, but a little bland.

### Last Resort Talisman
Effect: Cards generated during combat cost 1 random mana less.

* If this is too OP as-is, I can try changing it to once per turn.

### Overclocked Circuitry
Effect: You gain 2 more mana whenever you enter Burst.

* Can only be obtained if you specifically have the red Marisa exhibit. The black one doesn't help Burst much.
* Might be tweaked to also appear if you have the black Marisa exhibit and at least 2 red pips in your base mana.
* It provides mana instead of changing how much mana Burst itself provides. This probably doesn't matter other than looking a bit weird.

### Improved Mixture
Effect: Upgrades Unstable Potions generated during battle.

* Can only be obtained if you specifically have the black Marisa exhibit. The red one doesn't help Unstable Potions much.
* Might be tweaked to also appear if you have the red Marisa exhibit and at least 2 black pips in your base mana.
* It doesn't upgrade Potions added directly to the hand by Radioactive Elements. This is probably an acceptable edge case though. I don't know if Faithful Meditation does either.

### Knife Tsukumogami
Effect: Throwing Knives cost 1 mana less and deal 4 damage more. 

* I added damage to the knives because this would otherwise be strictly worse than Last Resort Talisman.
* I didn't go with Xeno's "knives always deal damage as though they were played" alternative because I felt that it might be too good, and that it would be interesting to occasionally encourage players to play the knives.
* TODO: Figure out why the description returns an error.

### Gear of Time
Effect: Whenever you start an extra turn, gain UUU.
* The original suggestion was "after your first turn, take another turn and retain your block". I thought that sounded too OP and went with Xeno's suggestion of instead adding mana whenever an extra turn starts.
* I originally considered some restrictions on it because many of Sakuya's extra turn cards have a double white pip or a double blue pip in their cost, but figured that it would be fine because every character has an extra turn card in their pool.
* I might tweak the effect because for non-Sakuya extra turns, the effect amounts to cancelling out the Time Limit mechanic.
* Rework idea #1: You start each combat with a Private Square in hand. It has Ethereal and temporarily costs 2U. (This is similar to the original suggestion, but is easier for the player to remember, and can be balanced by tweaking the Private Square's cost.)
* Rework idea #2: When you start an extra turn, you get a chance to copy one card. This ties into Blue's ability to copy cards, and is more interesting. 

### Sharpened Icicle
Effect: The first attack you play each turn also applies Cold.

### Three Fairies' Flag
Effect: (Planned) Active and Ultimate Skills cost 1 less Unity. (Current) Teammates start with 1 extra loyalty. (Needs to be changed...)
* TODO: Implement this properly.
